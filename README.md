# DIGITAL_SIGNATURE_USING_PHP_AND_AJAX
This is part of a big webportal for signing the PDF documents i have modified the serverside php script for handling the multiple documents signing this is also a part of my task during my internship.
The actual portal has been developed by an tool known as PHPRUNNER ENTERPRISE and i worked on to just improve the functionality.
